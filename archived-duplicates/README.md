This folder contains duplicate WordPress plugin/theme trees moved from app/app/public.

Reason: The active Local site root is app/public. The app/app/public copies were shadow duplicates that caused confusion when editing.

Moved items:
- warehouse-inventory-manager (plugin)
- warehouse-inventory* (themes)

If needed, you can restore by moving back into app/app/public/wp-content/...
