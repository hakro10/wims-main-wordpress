# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical discrepancies between the project documentation and the actual codebase structure of the Warehouse Inventory Management System. The system currently has inconsistencies in naming conventions, missing files referenced in documentation, and structural differences that need to be resolved to ensure proper functionality and maintainability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Documentation and Structure Alignment

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the project documentation to accurately reflect the actual codebase structure, so that I can navigate and maintain the system effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the documentation THEN all file paths SHALL match the actual project structure
2. WHEN referencing theme names THEN the documentation SHALL consistently use the correct theme name `warehouse-inventory`
3. WHEN listing plugin structure THEN all referenced files SHALL exist in the actual codebase
4. IF files are mentioned in documentation THEN they SHALL be present in the project or marked as planned/future features

### Requirement 2: Missing Asset Files Resolution

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all referenced asset files to exist and be properly configured, so that the application functions without missing resource errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the plugin references `dist/` folder THEN it SHALL either exist with proper bundled files OR be removed from documentation
2. WHEN CSS/JS files are enqueued THEN they SHALL exist in the specified paths
3. WHEN build processes are mentioned THEN they SHALL have corresponding configuration files OR be documented as manual processes
4. IF webpack is referenced THEN proper webpack configuration SHALL exist OR alternative build process SHALL be documented

### Requirement 3: Version Consistency

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent version numbers across all project files, so that I can track releases and dependencies accurately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN checking plugin version THEN it SHALL match across plugin header, constants, and documentation
2. WHEN checking theme version THEN it SHALL match across style.css, functions.php, and documentation
3. WHEN updating versions THEN all references SHALL be updated simultaneously
4. IF version bumping scripts exist THEN they SHALL update all version references consistently

### Requirement 4: File Structure Standardization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a standardized file structure that matches WordPress best practices, so that the project is maintainable and follows conventions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing plugin files THEN they SHALL follow WordPress plugin directory standards
2. WHEN organizing theme files THEN they SHALL follow WordPress theme directory standards
3. WHEN adding new files THEN they SHALL be placed in appropriate directories according to their function
4. IF legacy files exist THEN they SHALL be either updated to current standards OR removed

### Requirement 5: Missing Dependencies and References

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all code dependencies and file references to be valid, so that the application runs without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code references external files THEN those files SHALL exist in the specified locations
2. WHEN documentation mentions features THEN corresponding implementation files SHALL exist
3. WHEN build tools are referenced THEN they SHALL have proper configuration OR be documented as manual processes
4. IF Node.js dependencies are mentioned THEN package.json SHALL exist with proper dependencies listed
